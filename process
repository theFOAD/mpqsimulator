*match
set up colors, board size
set up [stable] board
set up 2 players [waves, agents, ai] [generalize from MPQ; specify if player can move enemy agents; if their agents move to the front during a turn when they take the relevant action; generalize to more players?]
player 1 takes turn [generalize?]
1. player down?
 no: other player takes turn, go to 1.
 yes: end loop
downed player loses
match ends

**stuff about passives needs to be included above and below
**also stuff about checking for downed/..? characters
**Do passives that trigger at the start of a turn also trigger when a player gets a match-5 and goes again? no
**When do attack tiles trigger? end of turn, not after a match-5

**turns
During a turn, 4 actions can be taken, they may or may not end the turn by default; this can be overridden by certain circumstances; if the turn doesn't end and more than 1 player is still alive, the player gets to take another action
1. swap 2 tiles [ends turn by default]
2. execute a power [doesn't end turn by default]
3. use a TU [doesn't end turn by default]
4. cycle enemy agent order [doesn't end turn; can't be done by player 2]

*ACTION: 2. execute a power
*ACTION: 3. use a TU
*ACTION: 4. cycle enemy agent order

*ACTION: swap 2 tiles

A
t1 is part of a match

This is clear in most cases. When t1 is a critical and only one color is matched, that color is the only match color. However, when t1 is a critical and more than one color is matched, I do not know what MPQ does. My _assumption_ is that all matched colors count as part of the first match, and that they resolve at the same time [confirmed!]. Two differently-colored match-3s do not add up to a match-5 however (for example).

B
mark the matching agent as instigator

This is clear in most cases. When t1 is a critical and only one color is matched, that color determines the matching agent. However, when t1 is a critical and more than one color is matched, I do not know what MPQ does. My _assumption_ is that the highest matching color determines the instigator. If more than one color has the highest value, I will assume the tankiest agent is the instigator.

C
determine criticals to be created by the marked matches

Every match generates only 1 critical. As far as I can tell, the critical's location is determined as follows
1>is there a horizontal sub-match?
  1.1>yes: find the lowest line containing 1 or more of such matches [there
      could be 2 of them...]
     >is there a crossing?
    1.1.1>yes: put the critical on the crossing closest to the center; pick
          the left one if it's a draw
    1.1.2>no [it's just a horizontal 5+-match]: put the critical on the tile
          closest to the center; pick the left one if it's a draw
  2.1>no: [it's just a vertical 5+ match]: put the critical on the tile
          closest to the center; pick the higher one if it's a draw

D
calculate the match damage including modifiers based on the
agent owning each marked match

Note that the damage may also depend on the enemy agent and any abilities
they have out; consider Colossus and Vision and their CD tiles.
